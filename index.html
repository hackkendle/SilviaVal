When a single day of not hearing from you would be so torturous. And then I made a decision that I will never regret🫂Try to be yours, and make you mine</p>
                            <p>About seven months of being with you now love🫂😚, and everyday I have learnt how to love and cherish and dream with you.</p></div>

That I may wake up with you my side and not to see you through a screen. But while we are still on our way there, I hope that we grow together in mind, in body, in spirit, to become one of great stature.</p>
